Data Distribution Visualization is a Python project developed in Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to create bar charts and histograms to visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables. Using a sample dataset (e.g., population data), the notebook guides users through basic data loading, preprocessing, and visualization using popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Examples include plotting the distribution of ages as a histogram and visualizing gender counts using bar charts. This project is ideal for beginners in data science who want to learn how to effectively represent data visually to uncover insights and trends. The code is open-source, easy to follow, and can be customized for use with different datasets or visualization types.
